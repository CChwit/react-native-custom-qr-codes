### Some things to know about QR Codes

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KA8hDldvfv0) is how QR codes are read.

If the right error correction technique is used in a QR code, [up to 30% of it can be restored](http://www.qrcode.com/en/about/standards.html).

This means that 30% of a QR code can be indeterminate and its data determined.
